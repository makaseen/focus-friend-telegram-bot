    "1Ô∏è‚É£ *Pomodoro Technique*: Work in focused 25-minute intervals with 5-minute breaks. This works with your brain's natural attention cycle and prevents cognitive fatigue.\n\n" +
    "2Ô∏è‚É£ *Environment Optimization*: Reduce visual and auditory distractions. Each distraction costs your prefrontal cortex valuable resources to inhibit.\n\n" +
    "3Ô∏è‚É£ *Implementation Intentions*: Create specific if-then plans like \"If I check my phone, then I will put it in another room.\" This reduces decision fatigue.\n\n" +
    "4Ô∏è‚É£ *Task Initiation*: Start with just 2 minutes of work to overcome activation energy barriers in the brain.\n\n" +
    "5Ô∏è‚É£ *Ultradian Rhythms*: Work with your natural 90-minute cognitive cycles followed by 20-minute rest periods.\n\n" +

    "1Ô∏è‚É£ *Nature Exposure* (5-15 min): Even viewing images of nature reduces cortisol and restores directed attention. A short walk outside is ideal.\n\n" +
    "2Ô∏è‚É£ *Movement Break* (3-5 min): Physical movement increases BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) which supports learning and neural health.\n\n" +
    "3Ô∏è‚É£ *Breathing Exercise* (2-3 min): 4-7-8 breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8) activates your parasympathetic nervous system.\n\n" +
    "4Ô∏è‚É£ *Sensory Switch* (5 min): Engage a different sense than the one you've been using for work to allow neural recovery.\n\n" +
    "5Ô∏è‚É£ *Social Micro-Connection* (5 min): Brief positive social interaction boosts oxytocin and reduces stress hormones.\n\n" +

    "1Ô∏è‚É£ *Task Decomposition*: Break work into tasks requiring less than 25 minutes. Smaller tasks create less limbic system resistance.\n\n" +
    "2Ô∏è‚É£ *Two-Minute Rule*: If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately. This creates momentum and dopamine release.\n\n" +
    "3Ô∏è‚É£ *Temptation Bundling*: Pair unwanted tasks with something enjoyable to leverage your brain's reward system.\n\n" +
    "4Ô∏è‚É£ *Implementation Intentions*: Create specific when-then plans. Example: \"When I sit at my desk, then I will work on task X for 25 minutes.\"\n\n" +
    "5Ô∏è‚É£ *Strategic Pre-commitment*: Use apps that block distractions or make public commitments to leverage your brain's consistency bias.\n\n" +
